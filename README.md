### Innocence Engine

My first 3D game engine.

### Overview

Rendering and core engine were based on tutorial [3D Game Engine Development Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEETnX-uPtBXP_B2yupUKlflXBznWIlL5) series, which were made by Youtube user [thebennybox](https://www.youtube.com/user/thebennybox).

Audio engine was developed by myself, check [OpenAL](https://openal.org)'s website for more information.
