# InnocenceEngine

My first 3D game engine.

Used libs: 

LWJGL 2.x( currently it's 2.9.3);
LWJGL 3.0( only for some OpenAL test);
slick-util;

Render and core engine were based on tutorial " 3D Game Engine Development Tutorial" series, which were made by Youtube user thebennybox:

Audio engine was developed by myself.

Test assets were all under CC or other common/ free/ open license which were downloaded from:

3D models: https://thefree3dmodels.com;
Sounds and music: https://musopen.org;
